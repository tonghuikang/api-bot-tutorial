# Welcome to the Poe server bot quick start. This repo includes starter code that allows you to
# quickly get a bot running. By default, the code uses the EchoBot, which is a simple bot that
# echos a message back at its user and is a good starting point for your bot, but you can
# comment/uncomment any of the following code to try out other example bots or build on top
# of the EchoBot.

import os

from fastapi_poe import make_app
from modal import Image, Stub, asgi_app

from battlebot import BattleBot
from catbot import CatBot
from chatgpt_allcapsbot import ChatGPTAllCapsBot
from echobot import EchoBot
from huggingface_bot import HuggingFaceBot

# Echo bot is a very simple bot that just echoes back the user's last message.
bot = EchoBot()

# A sample bot that showcases the capabilities the protocol provides. Please see the
# following link for the full set of available message commands:
# https://github.com/poe-platform/server-bot-quick-start/blob/main/catbot/catbot.md
# bot = CatBot()

# A bot that uses Poe's ChatGPT bot, but makes all messages ALL CAPS.
# Good simple example of using another bot using Poe's third party bot API.
# For more details, see: https://developer.poe.com/server-bots/accessing-other-bots-on-poe
# bot = ChatGPTAllCapsBot()

# A bot that calls two different bots (default to Assistant and Claude-Instant) and displays the
# results. Users can decide what bots to call by including in the message a string
# of the form (botname1 vs botname2)
# bot = BattleBot()

# A chatbot based on a model hosted on HuggingFace.
# bot = HuggingFaceBot("microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")

# The following is setup code that is required to host with modal.com

    # but the starter example disables the key check for convenience.
