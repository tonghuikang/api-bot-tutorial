# Welcome to the Poe API tutorial. The starter code provided provides you with a quick way to get
# a bot running. By default, the starter code uses the EchoBot, which is a simple bot that echos
# a message back at its user and is a good starting point for your bot, but you can
# comment/uncomment any of the following code to try out other example bots.

from fastapi_poe import run
from echobot import EchoBot

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run(EchoBot())

# A sample bot that showcases the capabilities the protocol provides. Please see the
# following link for the full set of available message commands:
# https://github.com/poe-platform/api-bot-tutorial/blob/main/catbot/catbot.md
# bot = CatBot()

# A bot that wraps Poe's ChatGPT bot, but makes all messages ALL CAPS.
# Good simple example of calling on another bot using Poe's API.
# bot = ChatGPTAllCapsBot()

# A bot that calls two different bots (by default Sage and Claude-Instant) and
# shows the results. Can customize what bots to call by including in message a string
# of the form (botname1 vs botname2)
# bot = BattleBot()

# Optionally add your Poe API key here. You can go to https://poe.com/create_bot?api=1 to generate
# one. We strongly recommend adding this key for a production bot to prevent abuse,
# but the starter example disables the key check for convenience.
# POE_API_KEY = ""
# app = make_app(bot, api_key=POE_API_KEY)
